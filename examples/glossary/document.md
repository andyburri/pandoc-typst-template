# Glossary Test

`#lorem(150)`{=typst}

@html is not needed in this example. It's just to show that the glossary can be used without it. The same with @fpga and @css.

The second occurrence of @html, @fpga and @css in the document shouldn't show the long name of the terms.

This text should link to @raspberry-pi.
